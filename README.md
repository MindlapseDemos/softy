We released this under fake nicknames and the MLFC label, because we didn't feel
it lived up to the standards we had set for "Mindlapse" productions. I think
that enough time has passed that it doesn't matter any more.

 - Code: John Tsiombikas (Nuclear)
 - Code: Michael Georgoulopoulos (Samurai)
 - Music: Thomas Einweg (Thom)
 - Graphics: Antonios Grizis (Alias Medron)

Softy is a fully 100% software rendering demo, no 3d accelerator needed.
 (however a powerful processor is needed to run this demo)
